(A): Redirects to a page containing a JSON dump of the booths loaded in the database.

(B): Exports the booths (and their associated information) as an Excel file

(C): Runs the allocation algorithm. The booths must have already been loaded into the database.

(D): Precisely edit the dimensions of a booth in the database. It will update the dimensions accordingly on the map.

(E): Highlights the location of the booth on the map.

(F): If booths have not be assigned a spot on the map, either by hand or through the algorithm, their IDs will be listed here.

Admins can also use the toolbar located at the top-left hand corner of the map to edit the booths directly on the map.
